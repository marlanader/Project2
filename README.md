# Temperature, Humidity and Soil Moisture Sensor

This project was developed by Marla Ebeid, Omar Helmy and Shireen Afify using CubeMX, C Keil uVision and arduino IDE. This project's main goal is to measure the temperature, humidity and soil moisture level. We used Keil uVision to communicate with the Microcontroller STM32 that is connected with the sensors and get data from them. On the other hand, we used arduino IDE to receive the measured data from the microcontroller and post them on the web server.
